### Appropriate Prototyping Methodology
Novice Users and the Correct Prototyping Method

Novice users are a category of end user that has little to no experience with the technology you are developing for. When creating prototypes for novice users to test/examine. You must consider that their technical understand will be much less developed than yours, so you must present your ideas and designs in ways that they can clearly understand and interact with if necessary.

One of the best paper based prototyping methods to use when consulting novice users is Storyboarding. This method involves drawing or rendering multiple individual parts of your project and showing them to the user in order of how they would appear if using the finished product. Storyboarding is excellent for getting feedback from novice users because storyboards donâ€™t contain any details about how the program itself would function, you and the user can go through the storyboard without worrying about them getting caught up and confused by technical jargon.

To test a prototype using storyboards. You can sit down with the user(s) and ask them to go through each step of the storyboard, without telling them what they would have to do to make it to the next screen. Instead ask them what they would do if they had this screen in front of them, where would they click, what would they type?. These questions can be asked to any user with any amount of technical knowledge and you would always get feedback and gain an insight into what that user is thinking and how their thought process works.
