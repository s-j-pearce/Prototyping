# Types of prototyping
### Concept prototypes:
A Concept prototype is a type of prototype which is developed in the early stages of a projects lifecycle. These types of prototypes are specifically designed in order to show what the final end product should look like. A concept prototype will also allow for users to get a feel for how the final product should function as well as how it should be interacted with. These types of prototypes are made very early on in the development process in order to allow the development team to have a clear sight on what they are trying to achieve. The main reason these prototypes are so sought after are because they are so easy to create as they can be created using basic resources such as paper and pens rather than advanced computer software.

### Feasibility prototypes:
Feasibility prototypes are created in order to help development teams get a better understanding on if their ideas are going to work in order to create the finished product. These types of prototypes are mainly focused on the technical aspects of the project. This is because the technical aspects are the most important part and if they don’t work then the rest of the project is pointless.

### Horizontal prototypes:
Horizontal prototypes only show the basic information such as the GUI. All of the technical parts and areas which are not seen by the user would not be shown in this type of prototype. The technical aspects are not required due to the basic information that is being shown however some context may need to be added along with the prototype as well as some specific functions in order to correctly explain how it works etc.

### Vertical Prototype:
Vertical prototyping is basically a simplified version of the core functions of the final application. The functions that are available will allow the user to enter data and then store that information in a database. This type of prototype will also allow users to see the data on the screen by displaying it through query’s and reports. Vertical prototyping is mainly used when a feature that is planned to be implemented is too complex within the system and is needed to be explored and broken down.

### Throwaway prototyping:
Throwaway prototyping is a very simple form of prototyping. This form of prototyping is done by learning or building from the feedback from the end user or testers of the previous prototype. The development team will build a working prototype, they will then hand this out to a small group to test. Once the group have tested the prototype, they will give feedback to the development team. The development team will then take in that feedback and implement it into the new prototype and then they will discard or throw away the old prototype as it is not needed anymore. This form of prototyping is perfect when you’re trying to build something that meets all the requirements of the end user.

### Evolutionary prototyping:
An evolutionary prototype is a fairly simple concept. It is just adding or building from the previous prototype. For instance, a development team will create an initial prototype and give it to a group to test. The testing group will then give the prototype back with some feedback and then the development team will simply add to the previous prototype or make changes to meet the requirements. This is similar to a throwaway prototype other than the prototype just gets added too instead of being thrownaway.
