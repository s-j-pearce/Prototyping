# Prototyping
What is prototyping? Prototyping in its basic form refers to the initial stage of a software's release where the development evolves and the product fixes can occur before the final release. This can also be known as beta testing or the beta phase. This is where and initial project gets evaluated by a smaller class of users before the full development is complete. Prototyping itself is part of a way more detailed process used in order to produce sophisticated software products and services. The idea or purpose of prototyping is so that when the code is in its near complete stage but the software itself is still in development, there may be bugs and user issues that need to be identified and solved. This process allows these bugs or user problems to be ironed out through using the software for its intended purpose. A lot of companies and organisations will roll out versions of their software to small groups for testing so that most issues can be resolved before the product either goes into its final stage of development or gets released for its intended end user.

### Types of prototyping
#### Functional Prototypes:
Functional prototypes are products with fully implemented functionalities, this meaning that the software or version that they release for testing will feature everything that the final version will feature. It might not look as pretty as the intended final cut version however it will have all the requirements of the final version.

The main reasoning for this type of prototyping is to keep the costs lower than those of a finished product. This can be achieved by;
1. Cutting down the products features.
With this type of prototyping, only part of all the features are implimented into this version of the prototype. All the features that are implimented with this release are fully functional so that users can test everything fully.
2. Cut down the functionalities.
All the features of the software are implimented into this prototype version however there are still some functionalities are missing from the software.
3. Cut down resources used in implementation.
Within the software, memory optimization is not implimented meaning certain features may load slower than others. The efficency of the software is not maximized to its full potential. High end computers are used in order to make up for the missing efficency lost in teh current build. Error handling is not fully implimented meaning that if you do encounter an issue or do something that shouldn't work then it wont come up as smoothly or as nice looking as intended in the final release.

#### Paper Prototypes:
Sometimes it is more beneficial to use paper prototypes instead of functional ones as it helps to go through on paper the steps of what should happen. With contextual design, the use of paper prototypes are stressed
