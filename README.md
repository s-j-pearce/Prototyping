# Prototyping
What is prototyping? Prototyping in its basic form refers to the initial stage of a software's release where the development evolves and the product fixes can occur before the final release. This can also be known as beta testing or the beta phase. This is where and initial project gets evaluated by a smaller class of users before the full development is complete. Prototyping itself is part of a way more detailed process used in order to produce sophisticated software products and services. The idea or purpose of prototyping is so that when the code is in its near complete stage but the software itself is still in development, there may be bugs and user issues that need to be identified and solved. This process allows these bugs or user problems to be ironed out through using the software for its intended purpose. A lot of companies and organisations will roll out versions of their software to small groups for testing so that most issues can be resolved before the product either goes into its final stage of development or gets released for its intended end user.

### Types of prototyping
#### Concept prototypes:
A Concept prototype is a type of prototype which is developed in the early stages of a projects lifecycle. These types of prototypes are specifically designed in order to show what the final end product should look like. A concept prototype will also allow for users to get a feel for how the final product should function as well as how it should be interacted with. These types of prototypes are made very early on in the development process in order to allow the development team to have a clear sight on what they are trying to achieve. The main reason these prototypes are so sought after are because they are so easy to create as they can be created using basic resources such as paper and pens rather than advanced computer software.

#### Feasibility prototypes:
Feasibility prototypes are created in order to help development teams get a better understanding on if their ideas are going to work in order to create the finished product. These types of prototypes are mainly focused on the technical aspects of the project. This is because the technical aspects are the most important part and if they donâ€™t work then the rest of the project is pointless.

#### Horizontal prototypes:
Horizontal prototypes only show the basic information such as the GUI. All of the technical parts and areas which are not seen by the user would not be shown in this type of prototype. The technical aspects are not required due to the basic information that is being shown however some context may need to be added along with the prototype as well as some specific functions in order to correctly explain how it works etc.
