# Prototyping
What is prototyping? Prototyping in its basic form refers to the initial stage of a software's release where the development evolves and the product fixes can occur before the final release. This can also be known as beta testing or the beta phase. This is where and initial project gets evaluated by a smaller class of users before the full development is complete. Prototyping itself is part of a way more detailed process used in order to produce sophisticated software products and services. The idea or purpose of prototyping is so that when the code is in its near complete stage but the software itself is still in development, there may be bugs and user issues that need to be identified and solved. This process allows these bugs or user problems to be ironed out through using the software for its intended purpose. A lot of companies and organisations will roll out versions of their software to small groups for testing so that most issues can be resolved before the product either goes into its final stage of development or gets released for its intended end user.
